# RGB_MAL
This is an RGB Matrix Animation sketch for the Arduino built with FastLED to use with a two button interface.

Many example animations available online (at least most of the ones I found) are not generally useful. 
Some are good examples of efficient ways to drive an RGB LED Matrix, but there is a fair amount of rework required.
These examples all use math based on the size of the LED Matrix, so that more implementations can redily use them.

The initial examples here are from the FastLED examples, licensed under the MIT license. 
Changes are licensed under the GPL v3. Which should be most everything before long.
